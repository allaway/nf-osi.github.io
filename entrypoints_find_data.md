# Suggested Entry Points for Finding Portal Data

Whether you’re a scientist, a bioinformatician, a data scientist, or a member of the general public looking for data, data on our platforms can be explored in multiple ways. This guide focuses on finding data in portals. For more information about finding data directly in Synapse, consult the [Synapse documentation](https://user-guides.synapse.org/articles/).

Before you begin, you might want to know more about:
* How is data shared? (Read our [data sharing introduction](https://nf-osi.github.io/about_portal_lifecycle.html).)
* What data can I access, and what can I do with that data? (Read our [governance docs](https://user-guides.synapse.org/articles/governance.html).)

## Exploring Portals
Portals are designed to enable data discovery. Though each has unique elements, portals invite you to explore data through various components, such as datasets, visualizations, programs, organizations, and more. Some portals even notify you of the latest data releases — look for a News section with this information, and sign up for updates.

One of the most common ways to find data on portals is through a feature called the **Explore** module. Explore allows you to browse data via files, datasets, publications, and other associated items. By opening the **Explore** tab, you can click an element of interest in a visualization, search by keywords, or drill down further with filters. Filters might include assay type, study lead name, diagnosis, or other information about the data by which to sort.

## Data Exploration Tips
1. When using the search bar, type exact terms. Our search bar may not return accurate results for misspelled or incomplete terms (unlike household search engines). 
2. For a high-level view of the kinds of data available in a portal, browse our visualizations — typically found at the top of an Explore module (read more in the step-by-step guide noted below).
3. Drill down into a ‘Detail’ page, such as an Organization or Study. For instance, you can view all studies, data, and publications associated with a particular organization, such as [Children’s Tumor Foundation]().
